Description: This is a flexible Bayesian mixture model package written in the probabilistic programming language Stan (<https://mc-stan.org/>) for R (<https://www.r-project.org/>). It estimates source mixing proportions by incorporating simultaneous likelihood evaluation from two independent data streams collected from the mixture of interest: one obtained from chemical tracers/biomarkers (i.e., a single tracer measurement per observation, e.g., from stable isotopes and fatty acids), and another yielding source composition (e.g., based on eDNA). `MixMustR` also allows for the estimation of an additional, unsampled source component to partially relax the assumption that the mixing proportions from all samples sources should sum up to 1. `MixMustR` should have wide applicability in ecological studies, particularly given the growing usage and availability of eDNA and metabarcoding methods to understand carbon source-sink dynamics as well as trophic interactions.
