\title{The MixMustR package.}
\description{
This is a flexible Bayesian mixture model package written in
the probabilistic programming language Stan (\url{https://mc-stan.org/}) for R
(\url{https://www.r-project.org/}). It estimates source mixing proportions by
incorporating simultaneous likelihood evaluation from two independent data
streams collected from the mixture of interest: one obtained from chemical
tracers/biomarkers (i.e., a single tracer measurement per observation, e.g.,
from stable isotopes and fatty acids), and another yielding source
composition (e.g., based on eDNA). \code{MixMustR} also allows for the estimation
of an additional, unsampled source component to partially relax the
assumption that the mixing proportions from all samples sources should sum
up to 1. \code{MixMustR} should have wide applicability in ecological studies,
particularly given the growing usage and availability of multiple tracers
spanning traditional stable isotopes and eDNA to understand carbon
source-sink dynamics, and a mixture of stables isotope, fatty acids and eDNA
to unravel trophic interactions.
